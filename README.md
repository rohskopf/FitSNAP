#### Using this package:
* [Required] This package expects a python 3.6+ version.
* [Required] Compile LAMMPS (lammps.sandia.gov) as a shared library, detailed instructions can be found here `docs/LAMMPS.md`. If you can open python and run `import lammps; lmp = lammps.lammps()` and it succeeds, you should be good.
* [Optional] (Required for atomic cluster expansion, ACE, capabilities ) Along with compiling LAMMPS with all of the typical FitSNAP flags, turn the ML-PACE package on.
    * Clone the ML-PACE package with the implemented ACE descriptor computes into your build directory from: git@github.com:jmgoff/lammps-user-pace.git
    * Follow the README.md and INSTALL.md in this repo to build lammps with ACE descriptor calculators

#### Installing:
* For the most recent bug fixes/code changes:
    * Clone this repository and add it to your PYTHONPATH environment variable. Periodically `git pull` for code updates.

* For stable, self-contained copy of this code:
    * Set up a Conda environment, then `pip install fitsnap3`. Less complications using mpi4py this way.

* See docs/INSTALL.md for more information.
* We recommend always using an up-to-date LAMMPS version as this is the preferred decriptor calculator.

#### Running:
* `(mpirun -np #) python -m fitsnap3 [options] infile` (optional)
* Command line options can be seen with `python -m fitsnap3 -h`
* Input files are described by `docs/TEMPLATE.in` and `docs/GROUPLIST.template`
* Examples of published SNAP interatomic potentials can be found in `examples/`
