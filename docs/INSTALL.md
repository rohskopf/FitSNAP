Instructions for installing FitSNAP 

FitSNAP3 requires two things:

1. LAMMPS
2. Several standard Python packages

* For information on building the LAMMPS shared library, see docs/LAMMPS.md

* If you are installing Python modules with a conda environment, it is useful to load the requirements with conda `conda install --file docs/requirements.txt`. If something goes wrong with them you could install the requirements manually. (listed in 'docs/requirements.txt')
