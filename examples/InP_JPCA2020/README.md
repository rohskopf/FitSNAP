## FitSnap3 Indium Phosphide example

This example will generate a potential for InP as published in 
Cusentino, M.A. et. al, J. Chem. Phys.  (2020).  This version 
of the Indium Phosphide potential uses the linear version of SNAP.
This particular example demostrates the Explicit Multi-Element (EME-SNAP)
version of SNAP where the weighted densities are now broken into
partial densities based on atom type leading to a better description 
of chemically complex systems.  This option is denoted by "alloyflag" 
in the FitSNAP input file.

#### Running this example:

To run this example, use the following command in this directory:

mpirun -n 4 python3 -m fitsnap3 InP-example.in

#### Files in this Directory

InP-example.in 

Input file containing parameters to run FitSNAP and generate
the Indium Phosphide potential

JSON/

Directory that contains all the training configurations which are organized
into different groups.

#### Files generated by example:

InP_pot.snapcoeff

SNAP potential coefficient file that contains all the beta coefficients for 
this potential.  This is one of two files needed to use this potential in LAMMPS

InP_pot.snapparam

SNAP potential parameters file that contains the hyperparameters and options used during 
the fit for this potential.  This is one of two files needed to use this potential in LAMMPS

InP_metrics.csv

Contains a variety of error metrics for all the training groups for this fit.

Note that the 20May21_Standard/ directory contains sample output for this example


#### Important input parameters for this example

rcutfac = 1  : Radial cutoff (hyperparameter) chosen for this potential

wj1 = 1.0 : Elemental weight on Indium for density expansion

wj2 = 9.293160905266721e-01 : : Elemental weight on Phosphide for density expansion

radelem1 = 3.812045629514403e : Indium per-element cutoff

radelem2 = 3.829453817954964e : Phospide per-element cutoff

type1 = In : Chemical symbol for element which should match training files in JSON

type2 = P  : Chemical symbol for element which should match training files in JSON

eshift = In : -1.65967588701534  : Per atom training data energy shift for In

eshift = P  : 4.38159549501534 : Per atom training data energy shift for P

quadraticflag = 0 : Quadratic SNAP is turned off, using linear SNAP

chemflag = 1 : Flag to turn on EME-SNAP

bnormflag = 1 : Flag to turn on normalization of j indices (speeds up MD runs)

wselfallflag = 1 : Adds wself contribution to the density
